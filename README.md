[00:17.32] Still and silent
[00:21.99] Calm before the storm
[00:26.33] Gold and diamond
[00:30.72] Jewels behind the throne
[00:42.72] 
[00:34.07] Into the night
[00:36.19] Out of the dark
[00:38.40] Take to the sky
[00:40.61] Chasing the stars
[00:42.82] All that we said
[00:44.92] All that we are
[00:47.10] Waiting to fly
[00:49.29] This is the start
[00:57.79]

[02:04.55] Now or never
[02:09.00] Strong in every step
[02:19.00] 
[02:12.22] Give me a sign
[02:14.36] Hitting the mark
[02:16.77] Take to the sky
[02:18.75] Chasing the stars
[02:20.97] Open your eyes
[02:23.10] Watching afar
[02:25.37] Waiting to fly
